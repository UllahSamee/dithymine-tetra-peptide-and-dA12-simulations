# dithymine-tetra-peptide-and-dA12-simulations

We simulated the dithyminetetra-peptide(serT2) and dA12 in 100ns.
The initial structures of the dithymine tetra peptide(serT2) and the dA12 complex used for the simulation is uploaded in this repository. \
So, that anyone access it openly and easily to work further on it. 

Thank you!
