# dithymine-tetra-peptide-and-dA12-simulations

We simulated the dithymine tetra-peptide(serT2) and dA12 in 100ns Molecular Dynamics Simulations.

The initial structures of the dithymine tetra peptide(serT2) and the dA12 complex used for the simulation is uploaded in this repository. \
So, that anyone access it openly and work further on it easily.

Description of the Files in this repo...

1. da12_sequence_used.fasta = initial sequence files in .fasta format, used to model the dA12 structure.
2. dA12_prep_optimized_minimized.pdb = the modelled dA12(Hydrogens added, optimized and minimized to 0.30Ã… rmsd)
3. serT2_ligprep_minimized.sdf = the 3D structure of the dithymine tetra peptide(serT2) minized via LigPrep
4. topcomplexe_used_for_simulation.pdb = Complex used for the 100ns simulations
